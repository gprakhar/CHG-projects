Kinship Estimator

In this project we would like to write a code that can tell the frequency distribution of coefficient of relateness.

The input would be:
1. number of Chromosomes
2. type of organism (density and distribution of hotspots)
3. number of genes / alleles / tags / features
4. number of generations to compute for

the items to participate in recombination would be called tags. These would be units of recombination.

Now there are two ways to do this,
a) procedural programming -- we use tags as items in list and using functions recombine them. Calculate kinship on basis of direct comparisoon of lists.

b) OOPs -- ??
